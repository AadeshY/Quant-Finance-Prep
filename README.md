# Quant-Finance-Prep

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to explore applications of data science, machine learning, and quantitative analysis in the financial domain. The projects within demonstrate how modern programming and machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze financial data, build predictive models, and develop quantitative strategies for various use cases in finance.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **BSE-A.py**
This Python script is a core component of the toolkit, focusing on initial data gathering, cleaning, and processing for financial datasets. The key features include:
- Data manipulation using `pandas` for structured financial data.
- Integration with external data sources for financial data retrieval.
- **Use Case**: This script can be adapted for preprocessing stock market, bond, or other financial time series data, making it ready for further analysis or modeling.

### 2. **BSE-B.py**
An extension of the previous script, **BSE-B.py** builds upon the preprocessing pipeline to include data analysis and modeling capabilities. This script covers:
- Statistical analysis of financial data using `numpy` and `scipy`.
- Basic implementation of financial metrics and indicators to study market behavior.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for developing custom financial models such as moving averages, volatility tracking, or mean-reversion strategies.

### 3. **Part A.ipynb** (Jupyter Notebook)
This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of financial datasets. It demonstrates:
- Data visualization techniques using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to identify patterns and trends in financial markets.
- Feature engineering for machine learning applications, including the creation of key financial indicators.
- **Use Case**: Can be used to analyze historical financial data for insights into market dynamics, asset performance, and risk factors.

### 4. **Part B.ipynb** (Jupyter Notebook)
This notebook applies machine learning techniques to financial data for predictive modeling. It includes:
- Implementation of supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
- Performance evaluation using cross-validation, confusion matrices, and accuracy scoring.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for building predictive models to forecast asset prices, detect market anomalies, or create automated trading strategies.

## Applications and Use Cases

This toolkit provides a starting point for applying data science and machine learning to financial problems. Example use cases include:
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing stock prices, bond yields, or cryptocurrency trends using statistical methods.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building machine learning models to forecast market movements or detect anomalies in financial data.
- **Financial Strategy Development**: Designing and back-testing quantitative trading strategies using historical data.
